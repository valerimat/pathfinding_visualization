### Algorithm visualisation
A fun visualisation game that shows how the most common pathfinding algorithms work.<br/>



The expected results:<br/>
BFS:<br/>

DFS:<br/>

# How to run:<br/>
To run you will have to have few components:<br/>
1.Visual Studio.<br/>
2.Sfml<br/>

open the folder of the project and just let cmake generate and execute.<br/>
After that you can run the game.<br/>
(Note: you might need to change the path of the SFML in the CmakeList.txt ,at the main folder.)<br/>

# How to use:<br/>
Choose the algorithm that you want to visualise using the terminal<br/>
to choose another one just close the window.<br/>
1.Put a start point and end point by pressinng the buttons.<br/>
2.put walls if you want.<br/>
3.press start<br/>
4.enjoy.<br/>
(Note: Dfs is not a path finding algorithm, but it is still included.)<br/>

#  Final notes:<br/>
this project might not use the best tools for this job, it was just a fun learning project<br/>
to learn few things as lambdas, void \*, runtime generation in sfml etc...<br/>
the project might have a few bugs.<br/>
