### Algorithm visualisation
Tried to make a fun game the most common pathfinding algorithms.<br/>



The result:<br/>
BFS:<br/>
![BFS Demo](demo/BFS.gif)

DFS:<br/>

A*:<br/>

Dijikstra:<br/>

How to run:<br/>
To run you will have to have few components:<br/>
1.Visual Studio.<br/>
2.Sfml<br/>

open the folder of the project and just let the cmake generate and executable.<br/>
after which you can run it.<br/>

Note: you migh need to change the path of the SFML in the CmakeList.txt in the main folder.<br/>

How to use:<br/>
you can choose the algorithm through the terminal<br/>
to choose a new one just close the window.<br/>
1.Put a start point and end point by pressinng the buttons.<br/>
2.put walls if you want.<br/>
3.press start<br/>
4.enjoy.<br/>

Note: Dfs is not a path finding algorithm but it is still included.<br/>

few final notes:<br/>
this project might not use the best tools for this job, it was just a fun learning project<br/>
to learn few things as lambdas, void \*, runtime generation in sfml etc...<br/>
the project might have a few bugs.<br/>
