Algorithm visualisation
Tried to make a fun game the most common pathfinding algorithms.

<img src="https://github.com/valerimat/pathfinding_visualization/blob/master/demo/BFS.gif.gifwidth="48">

The result:
BFS:
![BFS Demo](demo/BFS.gif)

DFS:
![DFS Demo](demo/DFS.gif =250x250)

A*:
![A* Demo](demo/Astar.gif =250x250)

Dijikstra:
![Dijikstra Demo](demo/Dijikstra.gif =250x250) 


//========================================================================================
How to run:
To run you will have to have few components:
1.Visual Studio.
2.Sfml

open the folder of the project and just let the cmake generate and executable.
after which you can run it.

Note: you migh need to change the path of the SFML in the CmakeList.txt in the main folder.

//========================================================================================
How to use:
you can choose the algorithm through the terminal
to choose a new one just close the window.
1.Put a start point and end point by pressinng the buttons.
2.put walls if you want.
3.press start
4.enjoy.

//========================================================================================
Note: Dfs is not a path finding algorithm but it is still included.

few final notes:
this project might not use the best tools for this job, it was just a fun learning project
to learn few things as lambdas, void *, runtime generation in sfml etc...
the project might have a few bugs.
